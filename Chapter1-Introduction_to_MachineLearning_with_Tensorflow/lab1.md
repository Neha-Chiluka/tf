# LAB - 1 Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow



#### Task 1 - Verifying Your Version of TensorFlow

1. Open Google Colab:

- Go to Google Colab.
- If prompted, sign in with your Google account.
2. Create a New Notebook:
- Once you're logged in, click on File in the top left corner.
- Select New Notebook.

3. Import TensorFlow:
- In the first cell of the notebook, enter the following code to import TensorFlow

`import tensorflow as tf`

- Press Shift + Enter to run the cell.

4. Verify TensorFlow Version:

- In the next cell, enter the following code to check the TensorFlow version

`print(tf.__version__)
`
- Press Shift + Enter to run the cell.

The output will display the version of TensorFlow, for example:

2.17.1


The version may vary on your system if you have not set up the environment using the steps provided in Preface.

In this exercise, you successfully imported TensorFlow. You have also checked which version of TensorFlow is installed on your system. 

This task can be done for any imported library in Python and is useful for debugging and referencing documentation.
